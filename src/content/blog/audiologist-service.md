"Hear" is some more about him!

### Fees

**Wax removal:** $110 ($55 for pension and concession card holders).

**Hearing assessment, hearing aid fitting, hearing aid adjustment/service fees:** $60-$250. Private health may provide some cover - if hearing is included in their extras package.

**Pension card holders** are eligible for the Hearing Services Program, which covers the cost of all appointments and provides a subsidy for hearing aids if required. Clients can choose to use that subsidy for standard devices, which are fully subsidised, or put it towards more advanced devices and pay a gap fee (varies depending on the level of device). Private health may provide some cover towards the cost of devices.
