We are sad to announce we are soon to farewell 2 valued staff members as they retire - our much loved Narelle from reception and Anne who has been an immense help at our Annexe with memory assessments.

We wish them a much deserved happy retirement and we also wish Dr Lydia all the best for her maternity leave!
