As we approach the cooler months, it's important to think about protecting yourself and your family from the flu. The influenza virus can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations.

## Why Get Vaccinated?

The flu vaccine is the best defense against influenza. Each year, the vaccine is updated to protect against the most current strains of the virus. Benefits include:

- Reduced risk of flu illness
- Lower severity of symptoms if you do get sick
- Protection for those around you, especially vulnerable individuals
- Reduced strain on healthcare systems

## Who Should Get Vaccinated?

We recommend flu vaccination for:

- Everyone aged 6 months and older
- Pregnant women
- Adults over 65
- People with chronic health conditions
- Healthcare workers
- Childcare workers

## When to Get Your Flu Shot

The best time to get vaccinated is in autumn, before the flu season peaks. However, it's never too late - vaccination throughout winter can still provide protection.
