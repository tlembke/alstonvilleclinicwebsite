          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Collection of information</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Practice will need to collect personal information as a provision of clinical services to a patient at the practice. Collected personal information will include patients':
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>names, addresses and contact details</li>
            <li>Medicare number (where available) (for identification and claiming purposes)</li>
            <li>healthcare identifiers</li>
            <li>medical information including medical history, medications, allergies, adverse events, immunisations, social history, family history and risk factors.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A patient's personal information may be held at the Practice in various forms:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>as paper records</li>
            <li>as electronic records</li>

          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Practice's procedure for collecting personal information is set out below.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Practice staff collect patients' personal and demographic information via registration when patients present to the Practice for the first time. Patients are encouraged to pay attention to the collection statement attached to/within the form and information about the management of collected information and patient privacy.</li>
            <li>During the course of providing medical services, the Practice's healthcare practitioners will consequently collect further personal information.</li>
            <li>Personal information may also be collected from the patient's guardian or responsible person (where practicable and necessary), or from any other involved healthcare specialists.</li>
            <li>The Practice holds all personal information securely, whether in electronic format, in protected information systems or in hard copy format in a secured environment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Use and disclosure of information</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Personal information will only be used for the purpose of providing medical services and for claims and payments, unless otherwise consented to. Some disclosure may occur to third parties engaged by or for the Practice for business purposes, such as accreditation or for the provision of information technology. These third parties are required to comply with this policy. The Practice will inform the patient where there is a statutory requirement to disclose certain personal information (for example, some diseases require mandatory notification).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice will not disclose personal information to any third party other than in the course of providing medical services, without full disclosure to the patient or the recipient, the reason for the information transfer and full consent from the patient. The Practice will not disclose personal information to anyone outside Australia without need and without patient consent.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Exceptions to disclose without patient consent are where the information is:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>required by law</li>
            <li>necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to a patient's life, health or safety or public health or safety, or it is impractical to obtain the patient's consent</li>
            <li>to assist in locating a missing person</li>
            <li>to establish, exercise or defend an equitable claim</li>
            <li>for the purpose of a confidential dispute resolution process.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice will not use any personal information in relation to direct marketing to a patient without that patient's express consent. Patients may opt-out of direct marketing at any time by notifying the Practice in a letter or email.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice evaluates all unsolicited information it receives to decide if it should be kept, acted on or destroyed.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Access, corrections and privacy concerns</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice acknowledges patients may request access to their medical records. Patients are encouraged to make this request in writing, stating any relevant time constraints, to enable the Practice to respond within a reasonable time.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Process:</p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Write letter to their own doctor requesting a half hour appointment to view their records.</li>
            <li>Advise any relevant time constraints.</li>
            <li>The Doctor will review their request and arrange an appointment.</li>
            <li>The Receptionist will contact the patient to advise the appointment time.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice will take reasonable steps to correct personal information where it is satisfied they are not accurate or up to date. From time to time, the Practice will ask patients to verify the personal information held by the Practice is correct and up to date. Patients may also request the Practice corrects or updates their information, and patients should make such requests in writing to the Practice Manager, or to their usual GP.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Practice takes complaints and concerns about the privacy of patients' personal information seriously. Patients should express any privacy concerns in writing. The Practice will then attempt to resolve it in accordance with its complaint resolution procedure. Any correspondence should be addressed to the Practice Manager via mail, telephone or email.
